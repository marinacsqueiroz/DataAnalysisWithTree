# DataAnalysisWithTree

This work reproduces a simple analysis and forecasting that can be performed on the database with decision tree and random forest algorithms.

The database used refers to hepatitis data, which was taken from https://github.com/zahangirbd/medical_data_for_classification/tree/master/data/Hepatitis.

For the analysis, ROC curves and AUC metrics are also used. The libraries used in this project are from scikit-learn.
